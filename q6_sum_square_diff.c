/*he sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the 
first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the 
first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.*/

//Answer 25164150

// this one is just simple arithmetic...

int main(void){
	int square_of_sum = 0;
	int sum_of_squares = 0;
	for (int i=1;i<101;i++){
		square_of_sum += i;
		sum_of_squares += i*i;
	}
	square_of_sum *= square_of_sum;
	int diff = square_of_sum - sum_of_squares;
	printf("%d\n", diff);
	return 0;
